She needs a web designer for the business website, she needs an accountant who will manage finances, she needs to handle different invoicing options…</p><p>Here, I would like to highlight the ten most important things you should know about running a small business.</p><h2>You should never forget your customers.</h2><p>The first thing as first – your customer. Yes, they are the most important part of your entrepreneurial life, and they are the persons who will tell you what you need to do for them. That’s the basic formula for success. You should never forget the foundation you have already built about your small business.</p><h2>You will need to hire the best team for your small business.</h2><p>You can’t do everything yourself when it comes for running a small business. Yes, probably you can do more things when you start, but if you want to be sure that your small business will continue to run on the right way to the success you will need to hire and build the best possible team for your company.</p><h2>You should not underestimate the value of internet marketing.</h2><p>Today, you can’t even imagine a small business without a website and different strategies of building the online presence. Internet marketing is a powerful way to build your own community and the foundation of your small business.</p><h2>You need to be unique and differentiate your small business from the competition.</h2><p>I know that the easiest way to run your small business is to do what everyone else is doing. But, it’s not the winning strategy for you. If you really want to build something exceptional, you will need to be unique and differentiate your small business from the competition. I am not talking here to make radical things, but I am talking about small things where you can really be the best.</p><h2>You will need to manage risk in the most appropriate way.</h2><p>Running a small business will be accompanied by risk and you as an entrepreneur should be aware of it. One of your tasks as an entrepreneur will be to manage the risk around you and your small business. You will need to define the biggest risk indicators and define possible strategies to manage risk inside and outside your company.</p><h2>You will need to build managerial skills.</h2><p>Managerial skills are skills that a manager will need to possess to maintain high efficiency in the way how their employees complete work tasks. You will need to be aware that running a small business will require such skills. Because of that start developing your own managerial skills as quickly as possible.</p><h2>You will need to learn with the higher speed than ever before.</h2><p>As an entrepreneur, you probably already have high knowledge, skills and experience about the main subject of your small business. But, it is not enough for successfully running your small business. As an entrepreneur, you will need continuously to work on developing new knowledge, skills and experience at a much higher speed than ever before.</p></div></article></main><footer class="mt-20 px-10 py-8 bg-gray-200"><div class="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-gray-700 text-center">© 2020 <a href="/site/" class="font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Código y Fika</a>.
